# Results<br />

## Methods<br />
• The GITS project was setup with tasks list for the testing of the Project - 3.<br />
•	A google sheet is created for the participants to enroll with their names and the preferred time slots for testing.<br />
• A test plan with detailed steps to perform tasks to test the project was provided.<br />
• The participants performed the tasks using both git and GITS.<br /> 
•	We used Google sheets to collect the data of the participants and their observations after they performed the experiment.<br />


## Materials<br />
• [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kZy8xhvoesJlyvAJx6cHh_h3wbta8ZXLeOhyh5rX6Mw/edit#gid=0) used for registration of participants and recording the participants' observations.<br />


## Observations<br />
<br />
Observational graphs for Git and GITS are as given below.<br />
<br />
The Pie Chart displays the number of participants who performed the experiements out of the 10 people enrolled.<br />

## Conclusions<br />
• Average time taken for Git was comparatively lesser than time taken for GITS. Reason for this was all the participants were familiar with Git and first hand experience for them on GITS.<br />
• Most of the participants took around 24 minutes to complete GITS tasks and 19 minutes for Git tasks.<br />
• Average commit count was comparatively less for GITS than Git because GITS reduces the number of commands to be executed for trivial tasks.<br />
• Most of the participants used 46/47 commands to complete both Git and GITS tasks.<br />
• All participants were familiar with Git beforehand and therefore they performed testing for Git with less difficultly compared to GITS.<br />

## Threats to Validity <br />	
• There was a biased advantage for Git since all the participants were familiar with it as compared to GITS.<br />
• The experiment results could have been more evaluating if each participant had no familiarity with Git and GITS.<br />
• Time constraint limited the number of tasks for testing and thus the commands were not exhaustive.<br />
• The data collected (9 active participants) is not sufficient enough to draw strong conclusions.<br />
